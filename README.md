### Topics: 

This three-day workshop will provide a fast-track introduction for individuals wishing to learn how to work with data suitable for statistical analysis of business problems. Preparing and enabling data (data wrangling) is an essential aspect of undertaking data intensive statistical research. Data wrangling is highly time consuming and can be complex especially when dealing with messy data, which is often encountered in the business world. There will be an emphasis on developing accurate, efficient, transparent and reproducible working practices when organising and enabling data.

Topics covered include:
*	Organising the data wrangling workflow 
*	Importing data sets into R
*	Preparing and enabling data for statistical analyses
*	Collecting data from online sources using Python
*	Dealing with messy data (e.g. web data, administrative data)
*	Using loops and functions to make the workflow more efficient
* Dealing with missing data
* Practical hands-on sessions introducing the methods and techniques outlined above.

The workshop would benefit any individual, whether in academia or industry, looking to become proficient in data wrangling using R as rapidly and painlessly as possible. Good general knowledge of statistcal methods and data analysis would be an advantage but not a necessity, as would some experience of working with data in an academic or industrial setting (e.g. social surveys, organisational data).

### Rationale: 

The Industrial Strategy recognises that a major challenge facing UK businesses and industry is how best to utilise big data to improve economic performance and increase productivity. A substantial barrier to exploiting the potential offered by emerging forms of big data is the lack of a suitably trained workforce with appropriate analytical skills. Many statistical techniques used in the social sciences are also suitable for the analysis of big data in non-academic settings, however social science graduates often lack experience in applying their skills and knowledge in non-academic research domains.
