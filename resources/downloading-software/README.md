# Data Wrangling: Organising and Enabling Data

The following are guidelines for downloading R, RStudio and Python to your machine.

### Method One:

#### Anaconda

The **Anaconda Distribution** is a data science package that installs a number of different programs on your machine, including RStudio, Python, and Spyder.
1. Head to [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
2. Select your operating system.
3. Download the most up-to-date distribution e.g. on 11/03/2019 the current version was Python 3.7.
4. Download the version of R compatible with your operating system [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

### Method Two:

#### Manual installation

It is fairly simple to install R, RStudio and Python and a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) separately.
1. R - Download the version of R compatible with your operating system [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/).
2. RStudio - Download the open-source version of RStudio Desktop that is compatible with your operating system [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3. Python - Download the latest version for your operating system [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
4. Spyder - This is a little bit trickier, follow the installation instructions at [https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html).

Unless you are very comfortable with software installation and operating systems, we suggest you choose **Method One**.
