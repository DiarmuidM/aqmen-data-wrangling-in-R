# Data Wrangling: Organising and Enabling Data

## Hackathon

### Challenge 1

Southwark Council distributes grants to voluntary, community and social enterprise organisations who provide services or conduct charitiable activities in its borough. Under the terms of the Open Government Licence for public sector information (version 2.0), Southwark Council makes its records of these grants available as open data sets.

The Council would like to know more about the organisations it funds: who they are, are they still operating, how much money the grant was worth to the organisation etc.

_Your mission, should you choose to accept it..._

1. Download all grant data from the Southwark Council website.
2. Clean this data and construct a longitudinal data set of grant records for 2013-2018.
3. Link this data set to charity administrative data provided by the Charity Commission for England and Wales.
4. Produce a paragraph describing the extent to which you could link grant records to charity information.

2. Clean this data and construct a longitudinal data set of expenditure for 2018.
3. Produce a paragraph describing the extent to which you were able to process this data and any issues you experienced.
